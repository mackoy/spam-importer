  <comment>A parent of Bootique-based projects that defines executable jar packaging strategy, upstream repositories, 
		and important plugin versions. It is not required that your apps inherit from it. But it does help
		with initial app setup. NO_M2ECLIPSE_SUPPORT: Project files created with the maven-eclipse-plugin are not supported in M2Eclipse.</comment>
